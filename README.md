# Neural Turing Machines

This is a Torch implementation of Neural Turing Machines, based on this
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) by DeepMind


The `modules` directory contains utility functions

## Roadmap

Experiments:
- ✅ basic copy
- 📦 copy with longer sequences than trained on
- 📦 repeat copy with fixed size
- 📦 repeat copy with random size
- 📦 sorting

Controller:
- ✅ Feed-Forward
- 📦 LSTM
