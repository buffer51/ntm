# Neural Turing Machines

This is a Torch implementation of Neural Turing Machines, based on this
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) by DeepMind


The `modules` directory contains utility functions

## Roadmap

Experiments:
- âœ… basic copy
- âœ… copy with longer sequences than trained on
- âœ… repeat copy with fixed size
- âœ… repeat copy with random size
- ðŸ“¦ sorting

Controller:
- âœ… Feed-Forward
- ðŸ“¦ LSTM
